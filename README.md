# Additional notes below â€” please read.
1. The u-net model was too large to push to github and can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zoP3UmzBmihgdkKlurVVzK1fd9ylbaqz/view?usp=sharing
![Alt text](model.png?raw=true)
2. All of the plots and figures (EDA, grad-CAM, etc) for this project can be found in the Jupyter notebook entitled `main.ipynb`. The report only contains the metrics table and graphs to show model performance.
3. As described in my writeup, I modularized things from an initial Jupyter notebook that contained everything. The png images saved in the `/figures` folder are from that inital ipynb, while those in `main.ipynb` were generated when running the modularized project.
