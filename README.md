# Additional notes below â€” please read.
1. The u-net model was too large to push to github and can be found at the following link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zoP3UmzBmihgdkKlurVVzK1fd9ylbaqz/view?usp=sharing

2. All of the plots and figures for this project can be found in the Jupyter notebook entitled `main.ipynb`. The report only contains the metrics table and the graphs for the loss function and accuracy.
3. I have included a folder called `not-for-submission` which contains supplementary code that I wrote during the development and experimentation process for the assignment, including playing around with various parameters. These  are not part of the main submission but provide insights into the iterative development and exploration of different approaches. 



These files are provided for reference purposes and can be consulted to understand the development process, experiments conducted, and decisions made during the assignment. They may contain incomplete or experimental code and should not be considered as final submissions.
